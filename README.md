This is a system I developed for the events of Tel Aviv University's Engineering Alumni.

The guests come with tickets containing a QR code to an event. By using a laptop, a camera and this code, a guest can scan his/her ticket and register. The guest gets his/her informaion: name, job title and company, printed on a sticker for a name tag with a DYMO printing machine.
